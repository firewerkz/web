      <description>So today version 1.1 of TimeToGo, TtG, was approved and released. I hope you enjoy the added capability of having the dates in the correct format for your device locale.
 Fastlane continues to make the process of test and development, as well as app screenshot capture and formatting a breeze. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t used it, I can thoroughly recommend it.
All the best, Dick.</description>

      <description>I know TimeToGo has only just been released, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the next version, which is now in review. This version display&amp;rsquo;s the dates and date picker in the correct format for the device&amp;rsquo;s locale setting.
 As I&amp;rsquo;d been working on all the other things needed for the App Store release, I wanted to get the first working version reviewed and released, and then to develop the functionality further, to make the app more useful for more people.</description>
