      <description>So today version 1.1 of TimeToGo, TtG, was approved and released. I hope you enjoy the added capability of having the dates in the correct format for your device locale.

      <guid>https://firewerkz.github.io/web/posts/2017-06-24-timetogo-updates-locale/</guid>
      <description>I know TimeToGo has only just been released, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the next version, which is now in review. This version display&amp;rsquo;s the dates and date picker in the correct format for the device&amp;rsquo;s locale setting.
 As I&amp;rsquo;d been working on all the other things needed for the App Store release, I wanted to get the first working version reviewed and released, and then to develop the functionality further, to make the app more useful for more people.</description>
